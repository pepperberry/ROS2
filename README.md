This repository acts as a guide for installing and configuring ROS2 on a Raspberry Pi [RPi] 5 device running the Ubuntu 22.04+ LTS operating system.

## Requirements

In order for the setup.sh script to run without any configurations required, the following are required:

- Raspberry Pi 5 (either 4 or 8 GB) with power source 
- 16 GB (minimum) microSD card with Ubuntu latest LTS flash
- Display device along with mouse + keyboard for the RPi

### Congifuring the Ubuntu flash

When configuring the settings for the microSD imager via the [Raspberry Pi imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), ensure that the __Ubuntu Desktop 24.xx LTS (64-bit)__ OS is selected and not the default Raspberry Pi OS. Also, set the _username_ of the RPi to "__test__". Without this change, you will need to edit the file location for sourcing the virtual enviornment among a few other commands.

## Setup

After the initial setup of your RPi device and it is connected to a reliable internet source, clone this repository into the main RPi home folder. 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:SU-Innovation-Lab/ROS2.git
```

The setup.sh script installs ROS2 and all of its required dependencies onto the local Raspberry Pi 5 device. 

<b style="color:red;">Note!</b> Upon successful completion of the setup.sh script, the RPi is expected to reboot. Once it starts back up, the 'ros2_venv' virtual enviornment should be activated and noted within the RPi terminal. You may need to hit the [Enter] key a few times during installation.

``` bash
# From the ROS2 directory, migrate to the setup script
cd ROS2/config

# Ensure that the setup.sh script is executable then execute it
chmod +rwx setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

After the RPi starts back up and the ros2_venv enviornment is active, test that ROS2 has been correctly installed on the device by running the following commands in __two seperate terminal windows__:


```bash
# Talker terminal
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```

```bash
# Listener terminal
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
```

You should see the talker saying it's publishing messages and the listener saying it heard those messages showing both the C++ and Python APIs working properly.
